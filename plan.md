Below is a detailed implementation plan using proper markdown formatting. This plan outlines all dependent files and step-by-step changes along with UI/UX and error-handling considerations.

---

## 1. New Pages & Routing (src/app)

### a. Landing Page (src/app/page.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Serve as the public-facing landing page introducing the crypto analytics website.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Import the new NavBar component.
  - Add a hero section with a big headline, descriptive paragraph, and two call-to-action buttons (“Sign Up” and “Login”).
  - Insert an `<img>` tag for a hero image with:  
    `src="https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Clean+modern+crypto+analytics+landing+page"`  
    `alt="Highly+detailed+modern+crypto+analytics+landing+page+showing+crisp+typography+and+responsive+layout"`  
    Include an `onError` handler that swaps in a fallback if needed.
  - Use semantic HTML and modern CSS classes (or Tailwind CSS if available) for spacing, colors, and responsive layout.

### b. Signup Page (src/app/signup/page.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Allow new users to register.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Import NavBar and common UI components (Input, Button from src/components/ui/input.tsx and button.tsx).
  - Create a form with fields: Email, Username, Password, Confirm Password.
  - Implement client-side validation to catch errors (e.g., password mismatch).
  - Wrap the form submission in a try–catch block that shows error messages upon failure.
  - On successful signup, update the auth state (using the newly created useAuth hook) and redirect to the analytics page.

### c. Login Page (src/app/login/page.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Let existing users sign in.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a form with inputs for Email/Username and Password.
  - Reuse UI components and include proper error handling.
  - Validate credentials (simulate or call an internal endpoint) and, on success, update auth state and redirect to analytics.
  - Provide a link to the signup page for new users.

### d. Analytics Dashboard (src/app/analytics/page.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Display crypto analytics, interactive charts, and a drawing tool.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Check authentication via the custom useAuth hook; redirect to login if not authenticated.
  - Organize the layout with a main section for charts (import the Chart component from src/components/ui/chart.tsx) and a sidebar or below section for drawing tools.
  - Integrate the new DrawTool component for users to annotate charts.
  - Fetch crypto data using a dedicated API route (see API section below); implement error handling (try–catch with fallback UI messages).
  - Use a grid or flex layout with proper spacing, typography, and modern colors.

## 2. Reusable Components

### a. NavBar Component (src/components/NavBar.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Provide consistent navigation throughout the site.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a component with links to Home, Analytics, Login, and Signup using Next.js `<Link>` component.
  - Use plain text labels styled with modern typography and spacing.
  - Ensure responsive design using flex layout.

### b. DrawTool Component (src/components/DrawTool.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Offer an embedded canvas for drawing annotations over analytics charts.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a component that renders an HTML `<canvas>` element and provides controls such as Clear and Save.
  - Use React hooks (useRef, useState) to track drawing state.
  - Implement error handling if the canvas API is unavailable.
  - Use inline styles or CSS from globals.css for a clean, modern look.

---

## 3. Authentication Utilities

### a. useAuth Hook (src/hooks/useAuth.ts)
- **Purpose:** Manage user authentication state.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a context/hook that stores and exposes user data and authentication functions (login, signup, logout).
  - Persist authentication state in localStorage.
  - Ensure error handling when accessing localStorage or during state updates.

---

## 4. Crypto Data API

### a. API Route (src/app/api/crypto/route.ts)
- **Purpose:** Serve crypto analytics data.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Build a Next.js API route that fetches data from an external placeholder (or directly from a service like CoinGecko).
  - Use try–catch blocks to manage fetch errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - Return JSON data that is later consumed on the analytics dashboard.
  
---

## 5. Global Styles & Utilities

### a. Global Styles (src/app/globals.css)
- **Purpose:** Ensure a modern, consistent look across all pages.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Define typography, colors, and spacing rules tailored to a crypto website.
  - Ensure responsive design using media queries or CSS grid/flex adjustments.
  - Amend or add classes as needed to support new pages and components.

### b. Utility Functions (src/lib/utils.ts)
- **Purpose:** Host helper functions, for example number formatting for crypto prices.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Add methods that transform raw crypto data into human-friendly formats.
  - Include proper error handling for edge cases.

---

## 6. Testing & Best Practices

- **Error Handling:**  
  Each form and API route must wrap asynchronous operations in try–catch blocks, displaying user-friendly messages on failure.
  
- **Validation:**  
  Use simple client-side validations in the signup and login forms, with inline error messages.

- **API Validation:**  
  Write curl commands to test the crypto data API endpoint. For example:  
  `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/crypto`

- **UI Consistency:**  
  Ensure modern styling using only typography, color, spacing, and layout. No external icon libraries or unwanted SVGs are included.

## Summary

- A landing page, signup page, login page, and analytics dashboard will be created inside the “src/app” directory.  
- The NavBar, DrawTool, and useAuth hook are built for reusability and modern UI.  
- The analytics dashboard fetches crypto data via a new API route and allows users to annotate charts.  
- All forms include proper error handling and validations.  
- Global styles are updated to ensure a modern, clean interface using typography, colors, and spacing.  
- Testing via curl commands is planned for API endpoints, ensuring robustness.
